#House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using the Linear Regression model. The dataset used for this project is named 'Housing.csv', which contains various features related to houses such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking spaces, and more. The target variable in this dataset is the price of the houses. The objective is to build a regression model that can predict house prices based on the given features.
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data: Contains the dataset 'Housing.csv'.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
images: Contains images of visualizations generated during the analysis.
README.md: Documentation of the project.
Usage
Ensure you have installed the required libraries as mentioned in the 'Installation' section.

Open the Jupyter notebooks in the 'notebooks' directory to run the code step by step.

The 'House Price Prediction.ipynb' notebook contains the main code for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

Results
After running the 'House Price Prediction.ipynb' notebook, you will obtain the following results:

Summary statistics and basic information about the dataset.
Visualization of relationships between specific features and the target variable using scatter plots and best fit lines.
A correlation heatmap to visualize the relationships between all features and the target variable.
Binary encoding and normalization of selected columns.
Model training and evaluation using Linear Regression.
Polynomial Regression analysis to find the best degree for each feature.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for house price prediction. Various data preprocessing steps, visualization techniques, and evaluation metrics are used to enhance the model's performance. The final model and its findings can be used to predict house prices more accurately and inform potential buyers and sellers. Further improvements may involve exploring different regression techniques, feature engineering, or fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve even better predictions.
